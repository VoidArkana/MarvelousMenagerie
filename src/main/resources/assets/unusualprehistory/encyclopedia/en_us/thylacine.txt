The Thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, only went extinct very recently due to it being persecuted by hunters
as they were thought to harm livestock and humans, but the reality was that these creatures were quite shy and even
capable of forming bonds with humans.

As such, as a proof of their tameness while you can't fully tame them you can decorate their necks with colorful
handkerchiefs by using a colored wool block on them, or you can remove them by using shears on them and get your wool
block back.

Another proof of their usefulness comes when you feed them their favorite foods, chicken or rabbit, as they will emit a
sound and alert you of nearby potential threats such as hostile and neutral mobs, making them useful allies when wanting
to know the location of hidden enemies.
