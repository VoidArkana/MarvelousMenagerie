Cooksonia is a group of land plants from the late Silurian and early Devonian, characterized for being the first
land plant that had a vascular system to transport water around its stem. These plants, being among the earliest
that ventured to land, can only be placed in grass, dirt or sand blocks near a water source to keep it hydrated,
perfect for decorating semiaquatic enclosures or those of creatures it shared the earth with at the time of its
existence.
