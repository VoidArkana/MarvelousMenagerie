Being the largest bird ever known, these solitary birds went extinct relatively recently, the most likely cause being
invasive species in its habitat. Their eggs are amongst the largest of any living creature ever, and they can be made
to lay one of them every few minutes by feeding them golden carrots, although the resulting egg will always be infertile
no matter what.

These eggs can be cooked by themselves to make a hefty meal, although when cooked they have a much better use by
combining them with carrots and potatoes to make a Jumbo Omelette, which is an extremely fulfilling meal that can also
grant a little bit of regeneration.

When consumed or used for crafting, the cooked eggs will leave behind the strongest part of the eggshell, which can then
be used to craft a special helmet that thanks to its sturdy material can give you a lot of knockback resistance, as well
as granting you the abilities of a bird by making you fall slowly to the ground as if you had wings, but be careful as
eggshells aren't sturdy forever, and as such the Egg Shellmet has a short useful life before it breaks beyond repair.
