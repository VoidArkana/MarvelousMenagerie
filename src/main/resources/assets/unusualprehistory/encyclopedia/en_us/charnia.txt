Charnia was an animal from the Ediacaran that lived attached to the sea floor, supposedly filter feeding using its bristly
and feathery body to absorb nutrients from the water. They can be oriented in 8 different directions, as well as bunched
together to make them bushier and get a couple of color variations in the mix.
