The Steller's Sea Cow was the largest sirenian in the world, and even rivaling a couple of large cetaceans when it came
to size. These marvelous creatures were insulated in a thick layer of blubber, which made them very sought after by
sailors and eventually led to their demise, but also made them so buoyant they stuck to the surface of the water, and
were sometimes even unable to fully submerge themselves, making them good water platforms to stand on.

These large amounts of fat are also present in their milk, which you can extract by using a bucket with these beasts,
and by drinking it you can temporarily gain some of their protective properties like their thick skin and resistance to
being moved around and increased lung capacity, but if you drink the milk as it is you will find that it is extremely
disgusting thanks to its high fat contents.

To mitigate the nauseous effects one can use the milk to instead make ice cream by using 3 snowballs, a bucket of the
milk and 3 bowls to be served with, and while the effects have an individually shorter duration than drinking the whole
bucket of milk, the positive effects of the milk are still there.

One can also gain the favor of the Sea Cows by swimming near them and not hurting them.

The Steller's Sea Cow's calves are playful and use their buoyancy to jump up and down, sometimes beaching
themselves, and as they are unable to return to land on their own one can pick them up in a bucket for transportation,
or simply build accordingly to avoid these incidents while they are still babies.
