Anomalocaris was a genus of Arthropod from the Cambrian, and for a while was thought to be the very first apex predator.
Despite early belief, Anomalocaris preferred soft prey unlike Trilobites, so they will not attack them but will eat
Trilo Bites if being fed by someone, making it shake with excitement and dropping a Sclerite in the process.
These Sclerites can be combined to create Ophthalmosaurus armor, which can protect them from almost any kind of damage,
and can be repaired with more Sclerites without having to take it off.

Anomalocaris was also well known to have been one of the animals with the best vision ever, if not the best. When they
grow up they will shed the lenses in their eyes, useful ingredients for the Anomalous Goggles. The aging process can also
be accelerated by feeding the babies Trilo Bites.

The Anomalous Goggles are a new item that can be crafted with two Anomalocaris Eye Lenses and one Anomalocaris Sclerite,
providing you with greatly improved underwater vision. They can also be further enchanted with either Cambrian Vision,
which lights up darker areas underwater for even more visibility, or Infernal Vision, for better vision under the lava,
these enchantments being mutually exclusive.
