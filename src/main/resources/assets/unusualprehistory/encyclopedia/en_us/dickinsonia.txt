Dickinsonia is a very enigmatic organism, presumably an animal, from the Ediacaran period, being one of the best known
creatures from that time even before the Cambrian Explosion. It is said that these creatures were among the first mobile
creatures ever, although they were not very fast and liked feasting on bacterial mats on the seafloor.
