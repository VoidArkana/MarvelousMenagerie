Hallucigenia is a very odd organism from the mid Cambrian that had a very enigmatic discovery story, baffling
scientists as they didn't know which way was up or down, or which way was front or back. Nowadays we know it had spikes
on its back to protect it from predators, with which it seems to be able to deliver a potent toxin that makes you hallucinate.

When they sting, there's a small chance a little bit of extra mucus will be secreted, with which you can either
brew this potent toxic into a potion or bake it into delicious snacks that will not only allow you to go faster, but
also will make everything around you look very colorful.
