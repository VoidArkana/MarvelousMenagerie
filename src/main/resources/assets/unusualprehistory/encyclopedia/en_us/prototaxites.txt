Prototaxites was a kind of fungus that lived in the Silurian and Devonian periods, being the largest non-animal organism
of its time since it shared the land with plants similar to Cooksonia, and it's been considered by many one of the
strangest organisms to have lived on earth. It is said that before plants took over land, fungi like Prototaxites came
to land and broke up the soil and feasted on decaying matter, over time making the land rich and fertile for plants to
slowly colonize.
It's because of this that when bonemealed, Prototaxites can grow to even larger heights and turn the
soil beneath into mycelium, offering a good renewable source of it, or it can also be used to craft mushroom stew. These
huge fungi will grow on their own, and bonemealing their base will only make them grow to gigantic sizes.
