A strange bird that called an island home, it went extinct when invaders from strange lands overtook its home,
unable to fight back. These birds have an affinity for melons and pumpkins, and they love pecking at them as a form of
enrichment, making them useful for automating melon and pumpkin farms.

Every once in a while they may also drop some of their feathers, making them a good source of them.

One can also feed them glistening melon slices to prevent them from breaking any pumpkin or melons if you would rather
prefer to make them less violent towards these blocks, and one can enable their insatiable hunger once again by feeding them
any of their favorite foods (pumpkin, melon slices or melon blocks).
