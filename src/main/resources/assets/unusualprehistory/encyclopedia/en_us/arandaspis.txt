Arandaspis is one of the earliest vertebrates ever discovered, having lived in the early Ordovician. They lacked jaws,
and as such they were stuck with silly faces all the time. Despite not having a jaw, they had a bunch of mobile structures
in their mouth that allowed them to feed by sucking in food.
