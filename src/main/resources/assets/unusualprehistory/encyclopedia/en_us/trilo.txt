Trilobites were a whole extinct class of arthropods that had many different shapes and sizes, coming into the scene
in the Cambrian and going extinct in the late Permian. Because of their great diversity then can come in many different
shapes and colors, making them perfect for collectors to have or simple aquarium decor.
When killed they will usually drop more than one piece of their meat, which can be used to feed Anomalocaris or
rescanned for Trilobite DNA.
