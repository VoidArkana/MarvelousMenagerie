Pikaia is one of the earliest chordates ever discovered. They had a notochord, a structure which would eventually lead to
the development of neural spines and vertebrae in general of all living vertebrates. They possessed some of the first
evidence of encephalization among chordates, that being the development of a visually distinct head.
