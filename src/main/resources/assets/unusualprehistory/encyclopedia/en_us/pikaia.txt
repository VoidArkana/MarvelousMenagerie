Pikaia is one of the earliest chordates ever discovered, living in the Cambrian period. They had a notochord, a
structure which would eventually lead to the development of vertebral columns in all living
vertebrates. They possessed some of the first evidence of encephalization among chordates, that being the development of
a visually distinct head.
