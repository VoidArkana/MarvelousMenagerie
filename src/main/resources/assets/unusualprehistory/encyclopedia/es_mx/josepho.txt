Josephoartigasia was the largest rodent to ever live, living only around 2 to 3 million years ago in South America.
They belong in the Caviamorpha family, making them related to capybaras and other similar rodents.
Much similar to their close relatives, these giant rodents have a very relaxed temperament and will make everything
around them relax as well, making any creature that would otherwise attack others not do so, not even hostile creatures
would attack the player unless they were provoked. They can be tamed using apples and saddled to ride them, although
they're not the fastest or strongest mount, or they can be ordered to sit around somewhere specific, and when sat they
can be stood on.
