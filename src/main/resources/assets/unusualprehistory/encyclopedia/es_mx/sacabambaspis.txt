Sacabambaspis is a genus of jawless fish from the Ordovician, and is the best known of its family. They were known for
their derpy faces because they lacked any jaws, so they constantly had their mouths open.
these fish, when killed, will drop themselves, which can then be cooked or surrounded in gold to make Golden Sacabambaspis
to tame Ophthalmosaurus.
