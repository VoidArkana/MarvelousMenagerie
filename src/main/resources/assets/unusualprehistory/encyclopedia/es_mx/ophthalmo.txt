Ophthalmosaurus was a genus of Ichthyosaur from the Jurassic, characterized from their huge eyes and being known to
superficially resemble dolphins and sharks in their body shape. Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles that were capable of
giving live birth since they could no longer return to land.
They can be tamed with a Golden Sacabambaspis and saddled
to make for a very fast underwater mount that can also jump out of the water for short periods. They will also follow
their owners if they're swimming around, but cannot be commanded like other creatures, and will even defend their owners
if attacked or themselves.
To further protect them, one can armor them up with Ophthalmosaurus Armor, which will make the armor absorb almost all
types of damage. The armor can also be repaired with Anomalocaris Sclerites, and both the saddle and the armor can be
taken off with shears.
